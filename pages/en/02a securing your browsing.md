title: Securing your browsing
---

By understanding who is trying to bypass your privacy and why it can really help you
guard against it and make these tips make a lot more sense. 

## Your ISP or Wifi Provider

The people who are selling you internet access will often try to make a bit of extra money
either by selling your browsing data or injecting adverts into your web pages.

If you are in a coffee shop using their wifi this is where attacks are the most dangerous. A malicious coffee shop may do a few harmful things:

* Replacing web page contents or injecting search results
* Selling detailed browsing data
* Snooping on your chats

### Solution 1.

Secure websites, which start with "https://" cannot be tampered with. Your internet provider can only see the first part of the URL, the domain.

Look for the padlock symbol in the address bar to ensure that the website is https.

i.e. if your browser at https://example.com/site/index.html any intermediary parties can only see https://example.com

### Solution 2. 

Using a Virtual Private Network aka a VPN. VPNs are a paid service which masks all your browsing data. Your Internet Provider can see that you are using a paid VPN but all the other data is totally secure even "http:" sites!

#### Some Popular VPNs:

* [Nord VPN](https://nordvpn.com/)
* [Express VPN](https://www.expressvpn.com/)
* [Mozilla VPN](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/products/vpn/)
* [Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com/) (This is free but it's a subsidised service.)
