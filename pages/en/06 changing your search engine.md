title: Changing your search engine
---

You can type search queries into the address bar to search using one of a selection of popular search engines.

The search engine you use will know what terms you searched for and may use this to build an advertising profile about you. If you dislike this behavior you can switch to a more privacy aware search engines such as [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) or [Qwant](https://www.qwant.com/).

You can switch between installed search engines by tapping on the icon in the search bar:
