title: Disable 3rd party cookies
---

This is a more extreme way of preventing cookie based tracking. It blocks any cookies that do not belong to the website you are on. Third party cookies are cookies that belong to a different domain than the one in your address bar. For example if you are browsing "https://newspaper.com" and there are adverts provided by "https://adprovider.com", they will use third party cookies which set unique information about you. If you visit another site with cookies from adprovider.com, adprovider.com will be able to create a profile about you with a list of the sites you visit with their ads on. Disabling third party cookies means that these adverts cannot access any identifying information they may have set as a cookie on another site.

This setting may break websites in rare cases, which is why it is not turned on by default, but will greatly enhance your privacy.

This prevents the majority of ways tracking networks follow you around the Web. You turn third party cookies off by using the settings page at: 

*Settings* ➔ *Sites and downloads* ➔ *Site permissions* ➔ *Cookies* ➔ *Block third-party cookies*
