title: Ad Blocking
---

These Ad blocking capabilities use 3rd party blocking lists to stop 3rd party trackers and adverts from loading in your browser. To install an ad blocker do this:

### Samsung Phones

Because Samsung phones have access to the Galaxy Store they can install extensions through the Samsung Internet browser itself. Open the menu and tap Ad-Blockers. Here you can turn on and install ad-blockers.

1. Open up the menu and select "Ad Blockers"
1. Tap on the down arrow to automatically install and enable ad-blockers

### Non Samsung Phones

Non Samsung Phones need to install Ad-Blockers through the Play Store. Here are a few:

* [AdGuard Content Blocker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adguard.android.contentblocker)
* [Disconnect for Samsung Internet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.disconnect.samsungcontentblocker)
* [Adblock Plus for Samsung Internet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.adblockplus.adblockplussbrowser)
* [Adblock Fast](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rocketshipapps.adblockfast)

You can then use the Ad-Blocker menu to activate them in Samsung Internet. 

1. Open up the menu and select "Ad Blockers"
1. Tap on the toggle switch to enable pre-installed ad blockers

You can turn on up to 5 ad blockers at the same time!
